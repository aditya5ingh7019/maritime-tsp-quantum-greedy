    "IMPORTANT CONTEXT:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "• This code does NOT claim quantum advantage.\n",
    "• Quantum optimization is applied only to reduced subproblems\n",
    "  (≤ MAX_QUBITS) due to NISQ-era limitations.\n",
    "• Classical greedy fallbacks are intentionally used for larger decision\n",
    "  spaces to ensure scalability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is designed to study:\n",
    "• How QAOA behaves when embedded inside greedy decision pipelines\n",
    "• Sensitivity to circuit depth, optimizer parameters, and random seeds\n",
    "• Limitations of shallow variational circuits on structured routing tasks\n",
